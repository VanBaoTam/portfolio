          I am a fourth-year Information Technology major at Saigon Technology
          University, currently awaiting graduation. I have been learning web
          development for two years and have one year of working in the field,
          including eight months of freelance work and three months of
          internship. I am actively seeking opportunities to become a full-time
          developer. My goal for the next year is to become a reliable developer
          and a valuable contributor to a company. Furthermore, I aspire to
          become an expert in web development.
